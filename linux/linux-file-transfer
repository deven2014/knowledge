# Linux file transfer

Transfer file between windows and linux 

use pftp (one of putty applications)

pscp lanpower.zip deven@me2:/home/deven

the server name 'deven@me2' can be either the real server ip or one putty saved session. The second case is very useful when you have to use a proxy to ssh your server since you can set the proxy in putty and save it as a session.
