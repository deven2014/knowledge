# Linux Terminal Commands

reference:<https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal>

Pasting in commands
Often, you will be referred to instructions that require commands to be pasted into the terminal. You might be wondering why the text you've copied from a web page using Ctrl + C won't paste in with ctrl+V. Surely you don't have to type in all those nasty commands and filenames? Relax. ctrl+shift+V pastes into a GNOME terminal; you can also do middle button click on your mouse (both buttons simultaneously on a two-button mouse) or right click and select Paste from the menu. However, if you want to avoid the mouse and yet paste it, use "Shift + Insert", to paste the command. If you have to copy it from another terminal / webpage, you can use "Ctrl + Insert" to copy. 

Save on typing
Up Arrow or Ctrl + P

Scrolls through the commands you've entered previously.

Down Arrow or Ctrl + N

Takes you back to a more recent command.

Enter

When you have the command you want.

tab

A very useful feature. It autocompletes any commands or filenames, if there's only one option, or else gives you a list of options.

Ctrl + R

Searches for commands you've already typed. When you have entered a very long, complex command and need to repeat it, using this key combination and then typing a portion of the command will search through your command history. When you find it, simply press Enter.

History

The history command shows a very long list of commands that you have typed. Each command is displayed next to a number. You can type !x to execute a previously typed command from the list (replace the X with a number). If you history output is too long, then use history | less for a scrollable list.

Example: you ran history and found you want to use command 1967. Simply enter


!1967
Change the text
The mouse won't work. Use the left/right arrow keys to move around the line. 

When the cursor is where you want it in the line, typing inserts text - ie it doesn't overtype what's already there.

Ctrl + A or Home

Moves the cursor to the start of a line.

Ctrl+ E or End

Moves the cursor to the end of a line.

Esc + B

Moves to the beginning of the previous or current word.

Ctrl + K

Deletes from the current cursor position to the end of the line.

Ctrl + U

Deletes from the start of the line to the current cursor position.

Ctrl + W

Deletes the word before the cursor.

Alt + B

Goes back one word at a time.

Alt + F

Moves forward one word at a time.

Alt + C

Capitalizes letter where cursor is and moves to end of word.

More ways to run a terminal
You can set your own keyboard shortcut to run a terminal. See KeyboardShortcuts for details of keyboard shortcuts.

You can run more than terminal - in tabs or separate windows.

You can also install guake (GNOME), tilda (XFCE / LXDE/Mate) or yakuake (KDE) and have a terminal which appears and hides on shortcut key. This can be particularly useful if you use terminal a lot. Drop down terminals can make things a lot easier if you are trying to run a desktop enviroment with a non defualt window manager and something goes wrong drop down terminals can run the orginal window manager --replace to restore a previous option to make things much less painful. 

An extremely handy tool :: Incremental history searching
In terminal enter:


gedit  ~/.inputrc
Then copy paste and save:


"\e[A": history-search-backward
"\e[B": history-search-forward
"\e[C": forward-char
"\e[D": backward-char
From now on, and many agree this is the most useful terminal tool, it saves you a lot of writing/memorizing...

All you need to do to find a previous command is to enter say the first two or three letters and upward arrow will take you there quickly:

Say I want:


for f in *.mid ; do timidity "$f"; done
All I need to do is enter:


fo
And hit upward arrow command will soon appear.
