iMemory library

1.

iMemory library is a library which provides an intelligent way to store and 
organize user's learning data for learning words.

2.

The global configuration and data mode for iMemory library, the 
configuration items are stored as class members. In the furture can design 
mechanism to read config file and set confiruation by interfaces. 

systemConfig
{
  "datapath":   "./data"
  "landictpath": "dict"          /* data/dict/ */
  "langdictfiles":              /* Multiple languages dict files */
  {
    "en": "en.list",            /* English */
    "sv": "sv.list"             /* Swedish */
  }
}


3.

The data model of the user's learning data:

learning_data
{
  uid:"",            /* 128 bit UUID */
  dataindex "",         /* global id in system for each learning data */
  description "",       /* Description for the usage of the data */
  new_word_index: 0     /* Next new word index in dict 
  last_learned_word: 'text'   /* last learned word */
  studying_words: [ "a", "b", "c" ] 
  mastered_words: [ "d", "e", "f" ]
  learned_words: { 
    'good': {
      ref_idex: 123456,              /* Integer */ 
      learn_history: "100101010",    /* Last 20 times 1: correct, 0: incorrect */
      mastered_flag: 0               /* If this word is mastered */
      mastered_score: 98,            /* 0 - 100 */
      familiar_score: 1000,          /* 0 - 1000*/
      total_learned_time: 12312      /* Integer, seconds for total learned time */
      mastered_learned_time: 12312   /* Integer, seconds for mastered the word */
    } , ...
  }
}

learning_history   /* Original BigData: Snapshot for each word in learning situation */
{
  [
    {
      word:                         /* Learned word */
      learned_time:                 /* Seconds in learning */
      answer:                       /* true, false */
    }
  ]

}

- the way to calculate a mastered_score and familiar_score
find out a suitable curl for represent a learnig score
25 - 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1
1     1  2  2  2  3  3  3  4  4  4  5  5  6  6  7  9 12 15 = 100






Data is stored as text files with JSON format. 

Each user learning data is a file with five backups in different folders:
  - 1 day ago
  - 3 days ago
  - 1 weeks ago 
  - 1 month ago
  - 3 month ago

Data of learning hisory will no backup data. Each dataindex one dir, each 
word learning history is stored in one JSON file. None english language has 
asc code problem, so use a "word2index.json" to find the history word file. 

An example for data storage:
uid: 'agbx-dsdd-xsdf-dsdf'
index: '0000-0001'
uid2index.json         /* Index for uid to index
/0000-0001
  0000-0001.json       /* learning data */
  word2index.json      /* word to index data */
  /lh                  /* learning history data */
    0000-0001.json     /* for example represent 'jag' in Swedish */
    0000-0002.json

Cache mechanism may needed when the program wants to get one user's history data 
for analysis.

Multiple language supporting can be realized by each user have several data 
for each language.

4.

The algorithms work on top of the user's learning data:

5.

Basic interfaces:

add_user_data(uid, desc)               /* Initiate a new user learning data */
  - return dataindex

/* Called in each time learn a word */
learn_word(text, dataindex, learnedTime, answer) 
  - void

/* The word will be set as the highest mastered in learning data*/
master_word(text, dataindex)

/* The word scores will be set to 0, but history data will not be cleaned */ 
reset_word(text, dataindex)

get_user_data(uid, dataindex)

get_user_learning_history(uid, dataindex)
