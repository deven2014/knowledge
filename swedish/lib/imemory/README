iMemory library

iMemory library is a library which provides an intelligent way to store and 
organize user's learning data for learning words.

The data model of the user's learning data:

learningData
{
  uid:"",            /* 128 bit UUID */
  studyingWords: [
    "a", "b", "c"
  ] 
  masteredWords: [
    "d", "e", "f"
  ]
  words: [
    {
      text: "good",
      refid: 123456,                /* Integer */ 
      learnHistory: "100101010",    /* 1: correct, 0: incorrect */
      showHistory: "100101010",     /* 1: shown, 0: not shown */
      masteredScore: 98,            /* 0 - 100 */
      familiarScore: 10,            /* 0 - 100 */
      learnedTime: 12312            /* Integer, seconds */
    } ,
    {
      ...
    }
  ]


}


learningHistory   /* Original BigData: Snapshot for each word in learning situation */
{
  [
    {
      time:
      learnedTime:
      answer:
      learnHistory
      showHistory
    }
  ]

}








The algorithms work on top of the user's learning data:
